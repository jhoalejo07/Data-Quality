# Data-Quality
This repository provides dynamic SQL scripts for checking data quality dimensions in SQL Server. The approach leverages metadata tables (INFORMATION_SCHEMA, sys.*) to build flexible queries that can be applied across schemas and adapted to other RDBMS.  Data quality dimensions are based on frameworks like DAMA DMBOK, ISO 8000, and ISO/IEC 25012.
